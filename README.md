## 📊 AI Assistant Usage in Student Life — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 📁 Description

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook that investigates a **synthetic dataset** simulating how students use AI assistants across different academic tasks such as writing, coding, and research.

### 📌 Objectives

* Understand student behavior and engagement with AI tools
* Explore how satisfaction levels vary by task type and student level
* Identify correlations between AI assistance, session duration, and outcomes
* Prepare insights for future machine learning or recommendation system development

### 🧪 Key Analysis Steps

* ✅ Data loading and basic structure checks
* ✅ Handling and inspecting missing values
* ✅ Statistical summaries and visualizations (bar charts, boxplots, heatmaps)
* ✅ Correlation matrix and grouped aggregation
* ✅ Satisfaction analysis by student level and task type

### 📊 Tools Used

* Python 🐍 (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle environment)
* Synthetic dataset (CSV format)

### 🔍 Key Insights

* AI assistance positively correlates with student satisfaction
* Satisfaction varies significantly by task type
* Graduate-level students tend to report slightly higher satisfaction for AI-supported tasks

### 📂 Files

* `student-life.ipynb` — Main notebook containing the full EDA
* `ai_assistant_usage_student_life.csv` — Synthetic dataset used (available on Kaggle)

---

### 🚀 Future Work

* Build a predictive model to forecast satisfaction or task completion
* Apply clustering to segment student behavior
* Introduce NLP for analyzing free-form student feedback (if available)
